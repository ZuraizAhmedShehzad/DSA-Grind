Welcome to my personal repository for C# Data Structures and Algorithms interview preparation! This repository contains a collection of C# solutions to common coding problems and data structures, curated for my own journey, but shared with the community to inspire and assist others.

## About

This repository is a reflection of my personal coding journey as I prepare for technical interviews. It houses my solutions to a variety of data structures and algorithms problems, implemented in C#. While I'm not actively seeking contributions, I'm more than happy to share this resource with you as you embark on your own path to success.

- `Sorting`: Contains C# implementations of sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.
- `Searching`: Includes C# solutions for searching algorithms such as Binary Search.
- `DataStructures`: Contains C# implementations of common data structures like LinkedList, Binary Tree, and Stack.
- `DynamicProgramming`: Includes C# solutions for dynamic programming problems.
- `GraphAlgorithms`: Contains C# code for various graph algorithms, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
- `Miscellaneous`: For any other miscellaneous problems and code snippets.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`:

   ```shell
